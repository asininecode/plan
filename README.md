Asinine Code - The Drunken Adventure
====
Goal:
Github suggested I call this drunken-adventure. This is gonna be great. So, inspired by /r/shittycode on Reddit, I decided that there should be a new open source movement sharing shitty code. Let's work on the worst code possible, and collaborate on it. 

How to contribute:
1. Submit code!
   - Fork the newsubmission project and send a pull request. (TODO) This folder will just have a simple README template that allows you to include a message in your code, along with a formal name for the program, if desired. If the code is accepted, it will be put in a main project based on category. Not all the details are figured out on the structure, but this document will be updated once that's in place.
   - Send a code snippet to asininecode@gmail.com
2. Contribute patches!
   - Fork something, make changes, and send a pull request.
   - Send patch files to asininecode@gmail.com

Rules:
1. It should run. If the compiler barfs on it, or the interpreter kills itself, it's broken, not asinine.
2. No malicious code. That shit isn't funny, it's a virus.
3. It should be hard to understand, barely legal, or easy to break for no obvious reason. Preferably all of the above.

(Likely to become) FAQ:
What kind of patches could I possibly do?
    Opposite refactoring. Unrolled loops. Abuse of preprocessor. Use of goto. Disjointed mishmashes of scripting languages. Use of undocumented API's. Stupid pointer tricks. Whatever Microsoft does. New API's that do the same thing as old ones in a very subtly different way. Let's make this the worst possible codebase. If you can't achieve greatness... achieve shit I suppose.

Why would you do something like this?
    I find bad code to be hilarious at times, and definitely a challenge to work on.
    
Are there any rules for submissions?
    Yes, but not many. Submissions need to run, to some degree. If the compiler barfs on it, I don't want it here. The whole point of the challenge is to make shitty code, not broken code. There's a subtle difference, because it's funnier when it doesn't make any damn sense that it would work, but does.

How do I contribute?
    Wonderful! You don't read documentation and doesn't afraid of anything! Read the README. Again, because you're already here, doing that.
